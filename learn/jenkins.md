## 1. Introduction to Jenkins
Jenkins is a Java-based automation server that helps automate various stages of the software development lifecycle. It allows developers to build, test, and deploy their applications efficiently. Jenkins supports a wide range of plugins, making it highly customizable and adaptable to different project requirements.

## 2. Installing Jenkins
To get started with Jenkins, you need to install it on your system. Jenkins can be installed on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. In this tutorial, we will cover the installation process for Linux.

### Steps to Install Jenkins on Linux
1. **Update your system**:
    ```sh
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt upgrade
    ```
2. **Install Java** (Jenkins requires Java):
    ```sh
    sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk
    ```
3. **Add the Jenkins repository**:
    ```sh
    wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add -
    sudo sh -c 'echo deb http://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'
    ```
4. **Install Jenkins**:
    ```sh
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install jenkins
    ```
5. **Start Jenkins**:
    ```sh
    sudo systemctl start jenkins
    sudo systemctl enable jenkins
    ```
6. **Access Jenkins**: Open your browser and go to `http://your_server_ip_or_domain:8080`.

## 3. Setting up Jenkins
Once Jenkins is installed, you need to configure it to suit your needs. This includes setting up security, managing user accounts, and configuring global settings. We will walk you through the essential steps to set up Jenkins properly.

### Initial Setup
1. **Unlock Jenkins**: Use the password from `/var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword`.
2. **Install Suggested Plugins**: Jenkins will recommend a set of plugins to install.
3. **Create First Admin User**: Set up your admin user account.
4. **Instance Configuration**: Set the Jenkins URL.

## 4. Creating your first Jenkins job
In this section, we will guide you on how to create your first Jenkins job. We will cover the different types of jobs available in Jenkins, such as freestyle projects and pipeline projects. You will learn how to configure build triggers, define build steps, and manage job dependencies.

### Steps to Create a Freestyle Project
1. **Create a new job**: In the Jenkins dashboard, click on "New Item" and select "Freestyle project". Give your job a name and click "OK".
2. **Configure source code management**: Go to the "Source Code Management" section and choose your version control system (e.g., Git). Provide the repository URL and credentials if required.
3. **Set up build triggers**: Go to the "Build Triggers" section and choose how you want your build to be triggered (e.g., Poll SCM, Build periodically).
4. **Define build steps**: Go to the "Build" section and define the build steps (e.g., Execute shell, Invoke Ant).
5. **Configure post-build actions**: Go to the "Post-build Actions" section and define any actions you want to perform after the build is complete (e.g., Archive the artifacts, Send email notifications).
6. **Save and run the job**: Save your job configuration and click on "Build Now" to run the job.

## 5. Configuring Jenkins pipelines
Jenkins pipelines provide a powerful way to define and manage your CI/CD workflows as code. In this section, we will introduce you to Jenkins pipelines and show you how to create and configure them. You will learn about the different stages, steps, and syntax used in Jenkins pipelines.

### Example of a Simple Pipeline
```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building...'
                // Add build steps here
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Testing...'
                // Add test steps here
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying...'
                // Add deploy steps here
            }
        }
    }
}
